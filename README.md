The Fleek Platform SDK provides an unified interface to help you quickly build applications that leverage our Fleek Services.

It's distributed as an ESM module for Web browsers, or CJS module for NodeJs Server applications. The server version provides a wider range of features, as some features are dependent of Native NodeJs modules.

To learn more about it read our documentation available [here](https://fleek.xyz/docs).

## Requirements

- Nodejs as runtime
- NPM, Yarn to install the SDK, or PNPM for development
- Familiarity with Nodejs, Frontend/Client side development
